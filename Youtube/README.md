youtube video tracking

**Warning: This is currently being worked on, fork and test with caution.**
**Also Note: Just swap out the console.logs with ga event functions. I will build that in as I get time to work on this more.**

Working events
---------------

Plays - with start time

Ends

Pauses - with time paused 

Jumped time - the amount of time some on skipped in the video

Messing with 
---------------
Perfect plays - when a user starts the video and watches it to the end without doing any other actions

Time buckets - track the amount of time watched in 5 second intervals
